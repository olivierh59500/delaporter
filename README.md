~~this is not working atm - check back in a day or two :-)~~

This is a rudimentary SSH private key password recovery tool. It does not claim
to be production quality, as the initial coding was done in a few hours. However,
PRs/issues are more than welcome.

BUGS:

- ~~does not support DSA SSH keys~~

- ~~does not exit when a password is found (FIXED)~~

- ~~false positives (FIXED)~~

- code is slow (max I have seen is 4 cores in an 8-core machine) is it Go or my skills?
