# ssh-key-cracker
this is not working atm - check back in a day or two :-)
put here so I can continue working on it when not in front of my main workstation
bugs:
false positives (this is a golang limitation, see the source code)
does not exit when a password is found
code is slow (max I have seen is 411% in an 8-core machine)
