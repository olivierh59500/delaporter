~~ this is not working atm - check back in a day or two :-) ~~

This is a rudimentary SSH private key password recovery tool. It does not claim
to be production quality, as the initial coding was done in a few hours.

BUGS:

- does not support DSA SSH keys

~~does not exit when a password is found (FIXED)~~

~~ false positives (FIXED) ~~

- code is slow (max I have seen is 5 cores in an 8-core machine)
